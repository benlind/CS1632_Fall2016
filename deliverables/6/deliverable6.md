# CS 1632 - Software Quality Assurance
Fall Semester 2016

DUE 6 DEC 2016

## Deliverable 6

For this assignment, you and a partner have been made Directors of Quality for a web application of your choice.  You will develop an entire testing strategy for that web application.  This testing strategy should cover all aspects of testing that we have covered.  It should show that you have thought deeply about the particular concerns of a specific company and how it produces quality software.

You should do independent research to determine general information about the company and web application (e.g. how many users do they have?  how many daily?  have there been previous large quality or security failures?  what infrastructure do they use?)  However, some companies can be very secretive.  You may make up specifics if you cannot find that information (e.g., you can't find  what language the Twitter back-end is written in).  IF YOU DO INCLUDE ANY MADE-UP FACTS, YOU MUST INDICATE IT IN THE PAPER.

It must be an application that has some sort of web front-end.  For example, learning about how Uber's self-driving cars are tested would be interesting, but it is not something that can be done for this project.  If you have any questions on whether or not your idea would work for this assignment, please ask me first.

Please remember to think about all aspects of testing and test strategies, as well as thinking what kind of function and non-functional requirements might be most relevant to that company.  You may wish to review the syllabus to see all of the kinds of testing that we have discussed this semester and when they are relevant.

Possible ideas: Amazon, reddit, Facebook, Twitter.  _Please feel free to email me to ask my thoughts on any particular web application._

Your paper should include the following three sections.  You should LABEL each section clearly.  You may use graphs, charts, etc. if these would help in understanding your position.

You must cite any sources that you use.  I do not care if you use MLA, Chicago, APA, IEEE, or any other citation style, but I should be able to look up your citations myself.

1. An overview of the site and what it does
2. Areas of concern and priority (e.g., security is extremely important for a bank versus a social networking site).  This should include any previous issues that have been discovered to impact the site (e.g., Home Depot credit card breach or Facebook's legal issues on advertising).
3. Testing strategies, e.g.:
   1. What kinds of tests should you have?
   2. What percentage of time/effort should be allocated to each?
   3. Should you bring in outside help to test?
   4. What kind of management structure should you use?
   5. What recommendations would you give to help increase quality?

This paper should be approximately 8 pages in length (double-spaced).

## Format
Every assignment should have a title page with:
* The name of the students in the group
* The title "CS 1632 - DELIVERABLE 6: Test Strategy for *name of site*"
